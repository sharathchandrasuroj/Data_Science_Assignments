    "#Logistic regression, on the other hand, is used when the dependent variable is categorical, meaning it can only take a limited number of values. In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a  binary variable, which can take on only two values, typically  labeled as 0 or 1. For example, predicting whether a person will buy a product or not based on their age, gender, income, and other factors.\n",

    "When the actual target class y is 1, the first term of the cost function evaluates to -log(hθ(x)), which becomes very large as hθ(x) approaches 0. Similarly, when y is 0, the second term of the cost function evaluates to -log(1 - hθ(x)), which becomes very large as hθ(x) approaches 1. This means that the cost function penalizes the model heavily for making highly confident wrong predictions, and encourages the model to output a probability as close to the true target value as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#To optimize the cost function, we use an iterative algorithm such as gradient descent or one of its variants. The goal of the optimization process is to find the values of the model parameters θ that minimize the cost function. In each iteration of the algorithm, the model parameters are updated by taking small steps in the direction of the negative gradient of the cost function with respect to the model parameters. This process is repeated until the algorithm converges to a set of parameters that result in a minimum value of the cost function. Once the optimal parameters are obtained, they can be used to make predictions on new input data."
