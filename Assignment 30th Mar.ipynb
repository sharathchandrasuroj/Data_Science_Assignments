There are several methods for selecting the optimal values of the two regularization parameters, alpha and l1_ratio, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grid Search:** Similar to Lasso and Ridge Regression, one approach is to perform a grid search over a range of alpha and l1_ratio values and choose the combination of parameters that provides the best performance on a validation set. This can be computationally expensive, but is a reliable method for finding the optimal values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Randomized Search:** Randomized search is similar to grid search, but instead of searching over all possible parameter combinations, it randomly selects a subset of parameter combinations to evaluate. This can be more computationally efficient, especially when the search space is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cross-Validation:** Cross-validation is a popular method for tuning hyperparameters. In k-fold cross-validation, the data is split into k-folds, and the model is trained and validated k times on different folds. The average performance across the k-folds is used to evaluate the model's performance. The optimal values of the parameters can be chosen based on the average performance across the k-folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information Criterion:** Another approach is to use information criterion such as Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) to select the optimal values of alpha and l1_ratio. These criteria penalize model complexity in addition to the training error and can help to avoid overfitting."
