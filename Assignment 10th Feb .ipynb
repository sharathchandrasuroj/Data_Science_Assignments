    "\n",
    "Opening a file consumes system resources, and there is often a limit on the number of files a program can have open simultaneously. Failing to close files can lead to resource leakage, where a program may eventually run out of available file handles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Integrity:\n",
    "\n",

    "Concurrency:\n",

    "Closing a file allows other processes or programs to access it. Some systems may have restrictions on the number of processes that can simultaneously access a file, and not closing a file can prevent other processes from reading or writing to it.\n",

    "Avoiding Bugs:\n",

When the block of code inside the with statement is exited, whether normally or due to an exception, the file is automatically closed."
