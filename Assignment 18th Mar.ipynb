    "In the Wrapper method, a machine learning model is trained using a subset of features, and the performance of the model is used as a criterion for selecting the best subset of features. The basic idea is to use the performance of the model as a feedback mechanism to guide the feature selection process.\n",

    "-Evaluate the performance of the model using a cross-validation or holdout set.\n",
    "-If the performance is satisfactory, stop. Otherwise, select a new subset of features and repeat steps 2-3.\n",
    "-The main difference between the Wrapper method and the Filter method is that the Wrapper method uses the performance of a machine learning model as a criterion for selecting the best subset of features, while the Filter method uses statistical metrics such as correlation, variance,or mutual information.\n",

However, it can capture complex interactions between features and the target variable, which is a limitation of the Filter method. \n",

    "Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function of a machine learning algorithm. L1 and L2 regularization are two common types of regularization used in Embedded feature selection. L1 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients of the features, promoting sparsity in the solution. L2 regularization adds a penalty term proportional to the square of the coefficients of the features, promoting small values of all coefficients.\n",

    "Decision trees are a popular machine learning algorithm that can perform feature selection as part of the model construction process.Decision trees recursively partition the data based on the features that best separate the target variable, and the importance of a feature can be inferred from the number of times it is used in the tree construction.\n",

    "3.Gradient Boosting: Gradient boosting is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong learner.In gradient boosting, a series of weak models are trained iteratively, and the features that contribute the most to the model's performance are given higher importance in subsequent iterations."
