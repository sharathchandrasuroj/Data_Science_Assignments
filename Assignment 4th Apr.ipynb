    "\n",
    "**Define the concept of entropy:** Entropy is a measure of the amount of uncertainty in a system. In the context of decision tree classification, we use entropy to measure the uncertainty of a set of examples with respect to their class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculate the entropy of the entire dataset:** To build a decision tree, we first need to calculate the entropy of the entire dataset. This is done using the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "#entropy(S) = -p_pos log2(p_pos) - p_neg log2(p_neg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#where S is the set of examples, p_pos is the proportion of positive examples in S, and p_neg is the proportion of negative examples in S. The entropy ranges from 0(when all examples have the same class label) to 1 (when the examples are evenly split between two or more classes).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculate the information gain of each feature:** To determine which feature to use to split the dataset, we calculate the information gain of each feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Information gain is a measure of how much entropy is reduced by splitting the dataset on a particular feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for information gain is:\n",
    "\n",
    "#info_gain(S, F) = entropy(S) - sum_i(|S_i| / |S| * entropy(S_i))\n",
    "\n",
    "#where F is a feature, S is the set of examples, S_i is the subset of examples that have the i-th value of feature F, and |S_i| is the number of examples in S_i.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Select the feature with the highest information gain:** We select the feature that maximizes the information gain as the feature to split the dataset on. This feature will be used as the root node of the decision tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursively split the dataset:** We repeat steps 2-4 on each subset of the dataset created by splitting on the selected feature. This process is repeated until we have a tree where each leaf node corresponds to a single class label or decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make predictions:** To make a prediction for a new example, we follow the path down the decision tree that corresponds to the values of its features. The leaf node reached at the end of the path represents the predicted class label or decision."
