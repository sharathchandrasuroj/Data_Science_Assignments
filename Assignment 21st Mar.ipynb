    "For example, if we have a categorical variable \"size\" with categories \"small\", \"medium\", and \"large\", Ordinal Encoding might assign \"small\" a value of 1, \"medium\" a value of 2, and \"large\" a value of 3. The key point is that there is an inherent order or ranking to the categories, and this order is reflected in the numerical values assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, Label Encoding is a technique that assigns numerical values to categorical variables without regard for any \n",
    "inherent order or ranking. For example, if we have a categorical variable \"color\" with categories \"red\", \"green\", and \"blue\",\n",
    "Label Encoding might assign \"red\" a value of 1, \"green\" a value of 2, and \"blue\" a value of 3. The key point is that the numerical values assigned have no inherent relationship to the categories themselves."
