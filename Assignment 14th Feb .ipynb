    "Multithreading is a concurrent execution model where multiple threads (smaller units of a process) run independently within the same process, sharing the same resources but executing different tasks concurrently. In Python, multithreading is achieved using the threading module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is Multithreading Used?\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrency: Multithreading allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently, making better use of CPU resources. This is particularly useful when dealing with I/O-bound tasks or tasks that can be performed independently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsiveness: In graphical user interfaces (GUIs), multithreading helps maintain responsiveness. For example, one thread can handle user input while another performs background tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parallelism: Although Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limits the execution of multiple threads in parallel within a single process, multithreading can still be useful for parallelizing certain tasks, such as CPU-bound operations using multiple processes.\n",

It typically happens when multiple threads or processes access shared resources concurrently, and the final result depends on the interleaving of their execution. Race conditions can lead to unexpected and undesired behavior in a program.\n",

    "Common situations that can lead to race conditions include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Read-Modify-Write Operations: When multiple threads perform read-modify-write operations on shared data without proper synchronization, the final value can be inconsistent.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Critical Sections: Portions of code where shared resources are accessed must be executed atomically to avoid race conditions. If multiple threads access these critical sections without proper synchronization, race conditions may occur.\n",
