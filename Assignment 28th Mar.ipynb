In OLS regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the dependent variable. However, when there is high correlation among the independent variables, the estimates of the regression coefficients become unstable and their magnitudes become large, which results in overfitting.\n",

One common way to encode categorical variables is to use dummy variables, where each category is represented by a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if the observation belongs to that category, and 0 otherwise. The coefficients of the dummy variables represent the difference in the dependent variable between each category and a reference category.\n",
